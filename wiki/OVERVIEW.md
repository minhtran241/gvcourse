Welcome to the SwiftUI tutorial! In this guide, we'll dive into the world of SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework, as we embark on the journey to build a comprehensive applicationâ€”GVCourse. This app will serve as a centralized hub for exploring all the courses and information offered by Grand Valley State University. SwiftUI's declarative syntax empowers developers to craft sophisticated and visually appealing user interfaces with significantly less boilerplate code, fostering a more user-friendly and efficient approach to UI creation. This tutorial will provide hands-on experience with SwiftUI's cross-platform capabilities and native integration. Throughout the tutorial, we'll leverage SwiftUI's powerful features such as declarative UI, data binding, and seamless integration to bring the GVCourse app to life. Screenshots and video clips will be seamlessly integrated to enhance your understanding of the app's functionality, making this tutorial an immersive learning experience.

# Introducing GVCourse: A Comprehensive Platform for GVSU Course Information and Announcements

The motivation behind developing the GVCourse application stems from the observation that, at Grand Valley State University school of Computing, the dissemination of information about new courses often relies on social platforms like Discord or email. While these methods are effective, occasional oversight occurs as Discord messages may go unnoticed, and a barrage of emails can lead to missed announcements. In response, GVCourse offers a streamlined solution, providing users with a centralized platform to access information about both new and existing courses.

# Why GVCourse is a Great Example of a SwiftUI App?

GVCourse not only presents an extensive catalog of new and existing courses offered by Grand Valley State University (GVSU) but also serves as a hub for course news and announcements. The application goes beyond by incorporating robust authentication features, allowing users to create accounts and log in using third-party authentication services like Google. When crafted with SwiftUI, these components exemplify the framework's capability to seamlessly create a cross-platform app with a native look and feel.

This tutorial explores how SwiftUI's declarative UI, seamless data binding, and integrative features come together to elevate the user experience. Through the inclusion of screenshots and video clips, the tutorial vividly demonstrates GVCourse' functionality, showcasing SwiftUI's prowess in the development of practical and user-centric applications.

# GVCourse App Features

## Course Catalog

The course catalog is the central feature of the GVCourse application. It provides users with a comprehensive list of courses offered by Grand Valley State University. Each course is represented by a card that displays the course name, description, and other relevant information. The course catalog also allows users to search for its properties. Users can also view all information about a course by tapping on its card.

## Course News and Announcements

Every information relating to course (new courses, course changes, etc.) is displayed in the course news and announcements section. The course news and announcements section is updated in real-time, ensuring that users are always up to date with the latest information. Users can read the full article by tapping on the card. Here is also the place to present posters for new courses.

## Authentication

The authentication feature allows users to create accounts and log in using third-party authentication services like Google. Users can also log out of their accounts.
